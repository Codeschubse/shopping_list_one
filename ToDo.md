# oneShoppingList

## ToDo before deployment

### Design

- [ ] change Category Header colour from black to maybe purple? However it's too distracting/disturbing rn.
- [x] change Name to shoppinglist:one(?) and remove the Kai's
- [x] change Name back to oneShoppingList. The other name is confusing.
- [x] wrong email in the footer
- [ ] check responsiveness again with mobile devices
- [ ] I never liked the design, maybe I can improve that at least a little (not too much, though, I still remember how much fuss this bootcrap is)
- [ ] change bootcrap theme to Bootswatch-Sketchy (after the select2 addon conflict is solved)
- [ ] add favicon (R-pentomino)

### Tech

- [ ] for now add invite to registration process to keep out bots and also not let number of users be too much for the tiny server
- [ ] add migration of db
- [ ] distinguish user rights. who may and may not edit stores, categories and orders?
- [ ] when someone makes changes to something, have some kind of versioning maybe?
- [ ] make it so that either there's no need for the select2 addon or that the select2 addon is covered by Bootswatch-Sketchy
