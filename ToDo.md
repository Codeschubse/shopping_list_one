# shopping list: one

## ToDo before deployment

### Design

* [ ] change Category Header colour from black to maybe purple? However it's too distracting/disturbing rn.
- [ ] change Name to shoppinglist:one(?) and remove the Kai's
- [ ] wrong email in the footer
- [ ] check responsiveness again with mobile devices
- [ ] I never liked the design, maybe I can improve that at least a little (not too much, though, I still remember how much fuss this bootscrap is)

### Tech

* [ ] for now add invite to registration process to keep out bots and also not let number of users be too much for the tiny server

- [ ] distinguish user rights. who may and may not edit stores, categories and orders?

- [ ] when someone makes changes to something, have some kind of versioning maybe?
